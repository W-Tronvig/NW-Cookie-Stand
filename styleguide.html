            <p>
            Pat and Pattie's Salmon Cookies was founded in 1984 by Pat Murphy and his wife Pattie. Pat and Pattie both studied marine biology at the University of Washington and had their affinity for cooking and baking combined with their intellectual backgrounds merge together in a unique blend of two amazing foods. <br>
            When they first met, Pat decided to cook a salmon dinner for their first date and Pattie had brought over her world famous peanut butter cookies. After an amazing dinner and dessert, Pat and Pattie wondered if they could combine this great meal into a quick, easy and affordable convenient food for all to enjoy and viola! Salmon Cookies was born! 
            <br>
            Ever since the inception of Salmon Cookies, it has been a Seattle staple 34 years in the making. With twelve locations total down the West coast -- three of which are in Seattle Washington -- Pat and Pattie's dream has truly come to fruition.

            Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.
            Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes. Something strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must have disrupted our communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat, but inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters. Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.

            Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields have been established on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.
