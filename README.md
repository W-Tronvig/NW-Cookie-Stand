# NW-Cookie-Stand

Title of project. 

## OVERVIEW

This is a web application and storefront website that displays cookie stores of various locations through Portland. The main page displays everything the user will need and will have links to other pages so that the user can visit merchandise, gallery, or navigate back to other items on the page. There is also an interactive table that can be updated by the user if they wish to dynamically add a store to see how that works.
