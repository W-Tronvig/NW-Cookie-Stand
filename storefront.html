                    <p>
                        Patrick (aka Pat) and Pattie's Salmon Cookies Shop was founded in 1984 by Pat Murphy and his wife Pattie. Pat and Pattie both studied marine biology at the University of Oregon and had their affinity for cooking and baking combined with their intellectual backgrounds merge together in a unique blend of two amazing foods. <br>
                        When they first met, Pat decided to cook salmon for dinner on their first date and Pattie had brought over her world famous peanut butter cookies. After an amazing dinner and dessert, Pat and Pattie wondered if they could combine this great meal into a quick, easy and affordable convenient food for all to enjoy and viola! Salmon Cookies was born! 
                        <br>
                        Ever since its inception, Salmon Cookies has been a Portland staple 34 years in the making. With twelve locations total down the West coast -- five of which are in Portland Oregon -- Pat and Pattie's dream of bringing people together to enjoy healthy baked goods has come true. 
                        <br>
                        The Murphy's have enjoyed being a part of your lives over the years and hope that you are able to make it into the shop at some point in the future to indulge in these tasty treats!
